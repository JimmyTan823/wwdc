This playground can help children practice the four arithmetic operations and stimulate childrenâ€™s enthusiasm for learning by an adversarial game. In this playground, the corrected calculation answer input by the player can make their ball bigger, thus occupying the screen and winning.

This playground is divided into three parts. The first part aims to tell the user how to use it. The second part is a single-player challenge mode. Users can choose the difficulty level of the challenge to fight against the computer player. The third part is a page that allows two users to play against each other simultaneously. I think a good product needs to bridge the people around and promote mutual communication so that they can get something beyond the software itself. In the double-player mode, children can play this playground with their families, by which they can not only practice the four arithmetic operations but also build up better relationships with their family. On the other hand, the adults can have fun with their children and keep themselves thinking actively.
